    <h1>ERSN Emergency Radio Net Playbook</h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-6">
      For Use During Wildfires, Snowstorms, and Other Disasters
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This playbook provides simple guidance for how to run and participate in an emergency radio
      net, in particular when phone and internet service may be unavailable. The goal is to ensure
      communication is clear, orderly, and useful for everyone listening.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a Net?</h2>
    <p>
      A net is a structured radio conversation where one station acts as Net Control and directs
      all communication. This prevents people from talking over each other and keeps critical
      updates from being missed.
    </p>

    <h2>What qualifies as an emergency?</h2>
    <p>
      An emergency net can be established at the discretion of an ERSN member, but typically it
      will be associated with wildfires in the area, power outages, cell-service disruption, or
      severe snow storms.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Should Be Net Control?</h2>
    <p>
      The most experienced operator available, with the clearest and strongest connection to the
      group (often the person who reaches the repeater most reliably).
    </p>
    <p>
      If that person needs a break or loses power, another station should step in. Ideally,
      multiple backups are identified in advance.
    </p>

    <h2>Net Control Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Announce the net and type ("directed net" = all traffic goes through Net Control).</li>
      <li>Keep a log of who has checked in and what updates are shared.</li>
      <li>
        Decide which traffic has priority:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Emergency</strong> (life safety, urgent evacuation)</li>
          <li><strong>Priority</strong> (urgent but not immediately life-threatening)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Informational</strong> (road closures, shelter status, weather conditions)
          </li>
          <li><strong>Routine</strong> (general coordination, questions)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Poll for active stations regularly if few people are on the air.</li>
      <li>Hand off duties every 2–4 hours if possible, to prevent fatigue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Interact with the Net</h2>
    <p>
      As a participant in the net, your role is to keep communication clear, brief, and helpful for
      everyone listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always wait for Net Control to acknowledge you before speaking, unless you have an emergency
      update that affects safety or evacuation. Use plain language, avoid unnecessary chatter, and
      share information that others in the community may need—such as road closures, shelter
      status, or evacuation changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of the net as a shared lifeline: every transmission should add value and keep the
      channel available for critical traffic.
    </p>

    <h3>Emergency Updates</h3>
    <p>Use immediately, even if someone else is talking. Say "Emergency" or "Break Break" clearly at the start.</p>
    <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-4 border-stone-400 p-4 mb-4">
      <p class="font-mono text-sm">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br />
        Emergency. Cal Fire have notified that the fire has crossed Moran Road near the bridge.
        Immediate evacuation needed for homes east of the river.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Priority Updates</h3>
    <p>For urgent but not immediately life-threatening information.</p>
    <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-4 border-stone-400 p-4 mb-4">
      <p class="font-mono text-sm">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br />
        Priority traffic. This is Bob on Pine Drive. A tree has fallen and blocked the exit to
        Highway 4. If you need to exit, drive South.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Informational Updates</h3>
    <p>
      Useful for situational awareness, but not urgent. Wait for Net Control to call for updates or
      for a break in traffic.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-4 border-stone-400 p-4 mb-4">
      <p class="font-mono text-sm">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br />
        Net Control, this is Ben X123. Informational traffic: the snowplows have opened up Blagen Road.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>General Questions / Routine</h3>
    <p>Ask permission before speaking, to avoid tying up the net.</p>
    <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-4 border-stone-400 p-4 mb-4">
      <p class="font-mono text-sm">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br />
        <strong>Jenny:</strong> Net Control, this is Jenny Y456. Routine Traffic.<br />
        <strong>NC:</strong> This is Net Control, go ahead Jenny.<br />
        <strong>Jenny:</strong> Can anyone confirm the status of Highway 4 at Dorrington?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Check-Ins / Status</h3>
    <p>
      When Net Control calls roll, reply with your identifier, location, and whether you have
      updates.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-4 border-stone-400 p-4 mb-4">
      <p class="font-mono text-sm">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br />
        This is Sarah Z999, at the fire station, no traffic at this time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>If activity is low:</strong> Net Control should call for check-ins every 10–15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Responding to "CQ"</strong> (a general call: "is anyone listening?"): Net Control
        should reply and invite the caller to check in.
      </li>
      <li>Keep transmissions under 30 seconds to allow others a chance to break in.</li>
      <li>
        Pause 2–3 seconds before speaking after pressing transmit, in case someone with a weak
        signal is trying to break through.
      </li>
      <li>Use plain language whenever possible — avoid codes, jargon, or abbreviations.</li>
      <li>
        If the Net is busy, Net Control may ask for callsigns only, before inviting members to
        transmit traffic
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Opening the net</h3>
    <div class="bg-stone-50 border border-stone-300 p-4 mb-6">
      <p class="font-mono text-sm whitespace-pre-line">
This is [Identifier/Callsign], acting as Net Control for the ERSN Emergency Net.

This is a directed net — please do not transmit unless called by Net Control, or if you have emergency or priority information.

Emergency information is anything that affects immediate safety, such as fire approaching homes, medical needs, or blocked evacuation routes.

Priority information includes urgent but not life-threatening updates, such as major road closures or supply shortages.

At this time, are there any stations with emergency or priority traffic? Please call now.

[Pause ~10 seconds]

Hearing none, we will now begin check-ins.

When called, please give your name, callsign, your location, and whether you have any updates.

If you have no updates, simply say "no traffic."

[Call roll call]

Are there any additional stations wishing to check in at this time?

Please call Net Control with your callsign only. When called, please give name, callsign, location and whether you have traffic.

      <p class="text-sm">
        <strong>A note on the roll call:</strong> if the net is expected to be busy and have many
        regular members checking in, going through the full roster may make most sense. However, in
        emergencies it is likely that few people are online at the start of the incident. In which
        case, you can provide a more open-ended check-in calling stations by their callsign suffix.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>NC:</strong> Calling stations with callsign ending in 1, provide only your callsign.<br

        <strong>Traffic:</strong> U951 G431<br />
        <strong>NC:</strong> Heard U951 and G431. U951, go ahead with your checkin.<br />
        <strong>U951:</strong> Dan, U951 here in Pinebrook. No traffic.<br />
        <strong>NC:</strong> Got you U951, go ahead G431 with your checkin.<br />
