  <h1>About ERSN</h1>

  <p>
    Ebbetts Pass is home to some of Earth’s oldest and most majestic trees—the <a
      href="https://www.gocalaveras.com/itinerary/high-sierra/arnold/">Giant Sequoias</a
    >, or "Big Trees"—and is recognized as one of the <a href="https://scenic4.org/"
      >United States' most Scenic Highways</a
    >. The Ebbetts Radio Safety Net (ERSN) was born from a deep reverence for the natural beauty of
    this region and a shared responsibility among residents to uphold the highest standards of
    stewardship. Our guiding principle is simple: “An ounce of preparation is worth a pound of
    cure.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Fires, earthquakes, and storms are as much a part of this landscape as the towering Sequoias.
    Fortunately, communities across California and throughout the US have proven the remarkable
    effectiveness of GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) technology in safeguarding people and
    ecosystems. By leveraging GMRS radios, ERSN ensures that residents along California’s Highway 4
    corridor stay connected when conventional communication systems fail. This network is a lifeline
    in times of crisis, providing real-time coordination and ensuring no one is left isolated during
    emergencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an era increasingly reliant on vulnerable infrastructure, ERSN highlights the enduring power
    of human connection, strengthened by technology and a commitment to mutual aid. Through weekly
    check-ins, equipment support, and an unwavering focus on community resilience, ERSN fosters a
    network of neighbors helping neighbors. Every new participant enhances the strength and reach of
    this vital safety net.
