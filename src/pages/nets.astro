    <h2>About the Biweekly Practice Nets</h2>
    <p>
      The Ebbetts Radio Safety Net (ERSN) hosts practice nets for GMRS operators in the area. This
      is a structured communication network designed to provide updates, share information of
      interest, and foster connection among radio operators. The net operates on GMRS channel 20
      (GMRS Repeater 6) and identifies by voice as WRDC296 R1. All licensed GMRS operators are
      welcome to join, and those interested in obtaining the PL (CTCSS) code can request it by
      emailing <a href="mailto:ersnnets@gmail.com">ersnnets@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Net Protocol and Participation</h2>
    <p>
      The ERSN net follows a clear structure to keep communication organized and ensure everyone is
      heard. Here are the main components of the practice net protocol:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Check-In and Announcements:</strong> The net begins with a check-in led by the Net Control
        Station.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Member Roll Call:</strong> Stations are called alphabetically by the last letter of their
        letter group. For example, a call sign of <code>WABC123</code> will be called as <code
          >C123</code
        >.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Comment Session:</strong> After roll call, participants are welcome to make announcements
        or share items of general interest. This is an open time for interaction, and we encourage anyone
        with information to contribute.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Visitor Roll Call:</strong> After the member roll call, visiting stations are invited
        to check in with their GMRS call sign, name, and location. Each visitor will be acknowledged
        in turn.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Emergency or Priority Traffic:</strong> Stations with emergency or priority messages
        may interrupt the net at any time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Check-In</h2>
    <p>To check into the net, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen for the prompt to check in, and wait for a pause to announce yourself.</li>
      <li>
        When prompted, provide your GMRS call sign, name, and location clearly. Indicate if you have
        any information to share during the Comment Session.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you're a visitor, wait until the Visitor Roll Call, and follow the same check-in
        procedure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of the Net</h2>
    <p>
      Once all participants have had a chance to check in and contribute, the net control will make
      a final call for any late or missed stations. After closing remarks, the repeater will be
      returned to normal use until the next scheduled net meeting.
