  <h1>Joining the Weekly Radio Net</h1>

  <h2>About the Weekly Net</h2>
  <p>
    The Ebbetts Radio Safety Net (ERSN) hosts a weekly net on <b>Wednesday nights</b> and
    <b>Saturday mornings</b> for GMRS operators in the area. This is a structured communication network
    designed to provide updates, share information of interest, and foster connection among radio operators.
    The net operates on GMRS channel 20 (GMRS Repeater 6) and identifies by voice as WRDC296 R1. Licensed
    GMRS operators are welcome to join, and those interested in obtaining the PL (CTCSS) code can request
    it by emailing <a href="mailto:ersnnets@gmail.com">ersnnets@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Net Protocol and Participation</h2>
  <p>
    The ERSN net follows a clear structure to keep communication organized and ensure everyone is
    heard. Here are the main components of the weekly net protocol:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Check-In and Announcements:</strong> The net begins with a check-in led by the Net Control
      Station.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Member Roll Call:</strong> Stations are called alphabetically by the last letter of their
      letter group. For example, a call sign of <code>WABC123</code> will be called as <code
        >C123</code
      >.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Comment Session:</strong> After roll call, participants are welcome to make announcements
      or share items of general interest. This is an open time for interaction, and we encourage anyone
      with information to contribute.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Visitor Roll Call:</strong> After the member roll call, visiting stations are invited to
      check in with their GMRS call sign, name, and location. Each visitor will be acknowledged in turn.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Emergency or Priority Traffic:</strong> Stations with emergency or priority messages may
      interrupt the net at any time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Check-In</h2>
  <p>To check into the net, follow these steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Listen for the prompt to check in, and wait for a pause to announce yourself.</li>
    <li>
      When prompted, provide your GMRS call sign, name, and location clearly. Indicate if you have
      any information to share during the Comment Session.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're a visitor, wait until the Visitor Roll Call, and follow the same check-in procedure.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>End of the Net</h2>
  <p>
    Once all participants have had a chance to check in and contribute, the net control will make a
    final call for any late or missed stations. After closing remarks, the repeater will be returned
    to normal use until the next scheduled net meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ERSN net meets every Wednesday at 7 PM and Saturday at 9 AM. We look forward to hearing from
    all participating members and visitors. For additional information, join us on our Facebook page
