    <h1>Pre-Disaster Preparation</h1>

    <p>
      When disaster strikes, staying connected is crucial. At <strong>Ebbetts' Radio Safety Net (ERSN)</strong>, we recognize the importance of preparedness in ensuring that vital communication lines remain open, especially when traditional systems fail. Whether it's wildfires, storms, or earthquakes, our volunteer-powered radio network, using GMRS radios, helps keep our community linked when it's needed most.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pre-Disaster Preparation is Essential</h2>
    <p>
      Emergencies can happen at any time. By preparing ahead of time, you're not only protecting yourself and your family but also contributing to the safety and resilience of your community. Pre-disaster preparation includes knowing your risks, having a communication plan in place, and ensuring that you have access to timely information when it matters most.

    <h2>Additional Recommendations for Fires and Storms</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Store Water</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of fires or storms, water sources may become contaminated or unavailable. Store at least one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days, with a focus on drinking and basic hygiene. You can use containers like jugs or bottles, ensuring that you have enough for drinking, cooking, and cleaning.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Emergency Food Supply</h3>
    <p>
      Stock up on non-perishable food items like canned goods, dry grains, and protein bars. A three-day supply of food for each person in your household is recommended. Ensure that these supplies are easily accessible and ready to go in case of evacuation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Fire-Resistant Materials and Evacuation Plans</h3>
    <p>
      For those in fire-prone areas, ensure that you have a fire-resistant kit, including fireproof blankets, protective clothing, and masks. Make sure you know at least two evacuation routes and have a designated meeting point for family members.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Maintain a Grab-and-Go Bag</h3>
    <p>
      Pack an emergency bag with essential items such as a flashlight, extra batteries, important documents (in a waterproof container), first-aid supplies, and a multi-tool. Include any medications or medical supplies needed for you or your family members.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Secure Your Home</h3>
    <p>
      Ensure your home is equipped to withstand storms and fires. This includes clearing gutters, trimming trees that could become projectiles in high winds, and reinforcing windows or doors to protect against flying debris. For fire risks, ensure your property is defensible by removing dry brush and flammable materials.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Backup Power</h3>
    <p>
      Consider purchasing a portable power generator to keep essential electronics running (e.g., lights, radios, medical equipment). Have extra fuel stored safely and ensure your generator is in good working condition.
