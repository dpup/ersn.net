    <h1>Pre-Disaster Preparation</h1>

    <p>
      When disaster strikes, staying connected is crucial. At <strong>Ebbetts' Radio Safety Net (ERSN)</strong>, we recognize the importance of preparedness in ensuring that vital communication lines remain open, especially when traditional systems fail. Whether it's wildfires, storms, or earthquakes, our volunteer-powered radio network, using GMRS radios, helps keep our community linked when it's needed most.

Pre-disaster preparation includes knowing your risks, having a communication plan in place, and ensuring that you have access to timely information when it matters most.
