Great to see everyone who came to the Meshtastic meetup at [Pine Brook HOA](http://pinebrookhoa.com/). The presentation deck is [available online](https://gamma.app/docs/Meshtastic-for-ERSN-Supplementing-our-GMRS-Emergency-Communicatio-0uqhv9yfiisu3yp) for anyone who wants to review the material.

It was especially exciting to connect ERSN with [TCARES](http://tcares.net) and explore the potential to establish a Motherlode Mesh network across our region.

## Resources Shared

Here are the key resources from the meetup:

- **[Mesh Monitor](https://mesh.ersn.net/home)** - Live monitor that watches MQTT traffic from nodes connected to our Motherlode topic
- **[ERSN Mesh Overview](https://ersn.net/mesh)** - Working group overview and instructions for joining our channels (will be updated soon)
- **[Getting Started With Meshtastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsIWyVzqJPM)** - YouTube video perfect for sharing with newcomers to Meshtastic technology

## Next Steps

### Primary Focus: Demonstrating Off-Grid Communications

Our main goal is to demonstrate consistent off-grid communications within the Ebbetts Pass area and potentially across the Motherlode counties.

- **Solar Node Deployment:** Procuring solar-powered nodes for installation at Rocky Ridge, Summit, and Red Hill using repeater configurations
- **Target Timeline:** Aiming for deployment during the 4th of July weekend

### Secondary Focus: Emergency Services Connection

Building communication infrastructure to connect beyond our local community to emergency services like San Andreas.

- **WinLink Research:** Exploring WinLink 2000 integration and potential Meshtastic-based solutions
- **Custom Solutions:** Investigating what we might need to build ourselves

## Future Considerations

Looking ahead, we discussed several potential initiatives to strengthen our emergency preparedness:

- **ICS Training:** Classes on Incident Command System and developing plans for how ERSN fits into the broader disaster response ecosystem
- **Regular Training:** Establishing training days and drills to help with onboarding new technologies and building operational readiness

The meetup was a great success in bringing together our community and identifying concrete steps forward. Stay tuned for updates on our progress with the solar node deployments and mesh expansion efforts.
