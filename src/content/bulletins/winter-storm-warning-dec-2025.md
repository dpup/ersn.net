A Winter Storm Warning is in effect from 10:00 PM tonight through 10:00 PM Friday for the Northern Sierra Nevada region.

## What to Expect

- **Heavy Snow:** 4 to 8 feet expected above 5,500 feet, with around 1 foot at 4,500 feet
- **High Winds:** Gusts up to 60 MPH with whiteout conditions likely
- **Travel:** Mandatory chain controls and road closures should be expected

Snow levels will stay near or above mountain passes through Tuesday, then drop significantly to 4,500–5,500 feet Wednesday through Friday. Periodic bursts of 1 to 2 inches per hour are possible.

## Critical Impacts

Heavy, wet snow combined with high winds will cause tree failures and power outages. Expect near-zero visibility at times with high risk of becoming stranded. **Travel is strongly discouraged.**

## Be Prepared

- **Charge your radios** and have emergency power and lighting ready
- **If travel is essential:** Pack flashlights, extra batteries, blankets, food, and water
- **Stay informed:** Monitor NOAA Weather Radio for updates

This is exactly why ERSN exists—when cell towers go down and power is out, radio communication keeps our community connected. Make sure your equipment is ready.
