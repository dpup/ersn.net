The [TCU September Lightning Complex](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/9/2/tcu-september-lightning-complex) follow-up meeting has revealed important insights for emergency preparedness.

[EPPOC](https://eppoc.org/) hosted [OES](https://oes.calaverasgov.us/) Director Eric at their October 1st meeting. Although traditional communications remained operational during the fires, and our net was consequently only partially activated, the crisis exposed the need for improved data to assure safe evacuations along Highway 4.

## Key Takeaways

The meeting highlighted critical gaps in evacuation planning and the importance of reliable communication systems during emergency events.

We highly encourage ERSN members to [listen to EPPOC's ZOOM replay](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/X_TQ2hA004ioNGACCr7CL2JC5gDPMO68KMrLTX3Km-y_qnmLalgIkJO7xxZVf5BS.lPSNDGKV1gUWJYtu) to better understand the challenges and improvements needed for future emergency response.

## Action Items

- Review evacuation routes and communication protocols
- Consider additional data collection methods for Highway 4 corridor
- Continue improving coordination between agencies and volunteer networks
