The Calaveras County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on February 24 to ratify a local state of emergency following the severe winter storm that struck the region the previous week.

## Storm Impact

The storm hit the West Point, Avery, Arnold, and Dorrington areas particularly hard. Dorrington received approximately **88 inches** of snow, while Arnold saw around **58 inches**. Heavy snow brought down trees and power lines across the county.

## Emergency Response

Between February 17 and February 23, emergency services responded to **476 calls** across the affected areas, including:

- **58** evacuations
- **96** calls for snow, tree, and power line blockages
- **118** storm-related calls
- **26** medical aid calls
- **76** welfare checks

## Infrastructure

PG&E reported hundreds of downed power poles and over **9,500 customers** without power. Roads became impassable at points during the storm, with snowplow crews and Public Works collaborating with PG&E to clear roadways and restore service.

## What the Declaration Means

Ratifying the emergency declaration opens access to additional state and federal assistance for ongoing response and cleanup efforts.

## Why This Matters for ERSN

Events like this are exactly why our network exists. When power goes out and cell service fails, GMRS radio and mesh networks keep our community connected. Make sure your radios are charged and your emergency plans are up to date.
